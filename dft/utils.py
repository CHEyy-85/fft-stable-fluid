    -----------
        n (int): 
            The size of the FFT, which determines the number of frequency bins.
            Must be a positive integer. This corresponds to the number of samples 
            in the input data that will be used in FFT computation.
        d (float, optional): 
            The sampling interval between consecutive points in the input data.
            Default to 1.0, which corresponds to frequecies of cycles per sample.
            Change to other values when there is temporal meaning in data so that
            frequency can be interpreted appropriately (e.g. Hz).

    Notes:
    ------
        - The Cooley-Tukey Algorithm increases computing efficiency by exploiting symmetry of complex number.
          As an implementation of the original Cooley-Tukey Algorithm, this does means that only input size of
          power of 2 can be handled.
        - This implementation uses a base case of N_min = 16, below which it switches
          to a direct DFT computation.
        - The algorithm uses precomputed twiddle factors for efficiency.
        - For inverse FFT (forward=False), the output is scaled by 1/N.
    
    Main Loop Algorithm Explaination:
    ---------------------------------
        The Cooley-Tukey algorithm splits the computation of the DFT of size N
        into smaller DFTs of even-indexed and odd-indexed elements. This relies on 
        the following recursive relation:
        
            X[k] = DFT_N[k] = F_even[k] + W_N^k * F_odd[k]

            X[k + N/2] = F_even[k] - W_N^k * F_odd[k]
            
        Here:
        - F_even[k] is the DFT of the even-indexed elements of the input.
        - F_odd[k] is the DFT of the odd-indexed elements of the input.
        - W_N^k = exp(-2j * pi * k / N) is the twiddle factor for the size-N DFT.
        
        This recursion halves the problem size at each step, reducing the overall
        time complexity from O(N^2) (in naive DFT) to O(N log N).
        
        In this implementation:
        - F_even and F_odd correspond to the blocks in F[..., :F.shape[-1] // 2]
        and F[..., F.shape[-1] // 2:] respectively.
        - The twiddle factor is precomputed and applied as `factor_`.
        - The recursion builds up results by combining the even and odd parts 
        until the entire DFT of size N is constructed.
        - A bottom-up iterative approach is chosen over a top-down approach for
          performance, but the idea is the same.
